# Understanding some basic concept of the Astro framework

Build a interactive cart with Astro and React.

Product page is built with Astro (static generated) and cart is built with React (client side interactivity).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── cart/
│   │   │   ├── Client Side Cart Components (React)
│   │   └── product/
│   │       ├── Static Product Components (Astro)
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Basic Layouts
│   └── pages/
│       └── Static Pages
└── package.json
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
